/**
 * screeps-packrat
 * ---------------
 * Lightning-fast and memory-efficient serialization of Screeps IDs, Coords, and RoomPositions
 * Code written by Muon as part of Overmind Screeps AI. Feel free to adapt as desired.
 * Package repository: https://github.com/bencbartlett/screeps-packrat
 *
 * Plain JS version is available in the #share-thy-code channel on the Screeps Slack.
 *
 * To use: import desired functions from module, or import entire module on main and use functions from global.
 * To benchmark: import tests file, PackratTests.run()
 *
 * Exported functions (available on global):

 * ** Memory reduction for list functions is the asymptotic limit of lists containing many entries. Lower reductions
 *    can be expected for smaller lists.
